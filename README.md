# Data Entry Form.

![DataEntryForm](DataEntryFrom.jpg)
 So I've taught myself Java over the last 3 days.
 I've created a basic data entry form.
 It captures first name, last name and zip code.
 Then sends the data to a Mongo database.
 After the data is submitted, a messagebox appears to notify you that is was submitted.

I wanted to dip my toe into Java, and so far I like it more than C-sharp(C#)
